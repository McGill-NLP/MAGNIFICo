User1: Based on the schema, some values are prevalent.

User2: What do you mean by prevalent?

User1: Oh, I just mean the most frequent values or the values equal to the mode.

User2: Ah, got it. So, what do you think is the most prevalent major among the students?

User1: Well, I don't have the actual data, but I would guess it's probably something like computer science or business.

User2: That makes sense. And what about the dorms? Which one has the highest student capacity?

User1: Let me check the schema... Ah, it looks like the Dorm table has a column for student capacity. I'm not sure which one has the highest capacity, though.

User2: No worries. Do you know if the dorms are segregated by gender?

User1: Yes, actually. The Dorm table has a column for gender that specifies whether the dorm is for males, females, or both.

User2: Interesting. And what about the amenities in the dorms? Are there any that are particularly popular?

User1: Well, there's a separate table for Dorm_amenity that lists all the amenities available, and another table called Has_amenity that links each dorm to the amenities it has. So, we could probably look at the Has_amenity table to see which amenities are most common.

User2: That's a good idea. Do you know if any students live in more than one dorm?

User1: Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me check the Lives_in table... No, it looks like each row in that table links a single student to a single dorm.

User2: Okay, good to know. And what about the city codes in the Student table? Do you know what those represent?

User1: Yes, I believe those are just three-letter codes for the cities where the students are from.

User2: Oh, interesting. Thanks for explaining that. Do you know if the Student table has any foreign keys?

User1: Yes, actually. The Major and Advisor columns both have foreign keys that link to other tables in the database.

User2: Ah, I see. And what do those foreign keys link to?

User1: The Major column links to the Major table, which has information about each major, such as its name and the department it belongs to.

User2: That makes sense. And what about the Advisor column?

User1: The Advisor column links to the Faculty table, which has information about each faculty member, including their name and department.

User2: Interesting. Do you know if there's a table for extracurricular activities?

User1: Yes, there is. It's called Extracurricular and it has information about each activity, such as its name and the faculty advisor for the activity.

User2: Ah, I see. That's pretty useful. Do you know if there's a table for courses?

User1: Yes, there is. It's called Course and it has information about each course, such as its name, department, and the faculty member teaching the course.

User2: That's interesting. Are there any foreign keys in that table?

User1: Yes, there are two foreign keys in that table. One links to the Major table to indicate which major the course belongs to, and the other links to the Faculty table to indicate which faculty member is teaching the course.

User2: Ah, I see. That makes sense. Do you know if there's a table for grades?

User1: Yes, there is. It's called Grade and it has information about each student's grade in each course.

User2: That's pretty useful. Are there any foreign keys in that table?

User2: Ah, I see. That's pretty interesting. Do you know if there's a table for campus facilities?

User2: That's useful. Are there any foreign keys in that table?

User1: No, there aren't any foreign keys in that table. It's just a standalone table with information about the facilities on campus.

User2: Ah, I see. That's pretty cool. Do you know if there's a table for campus jobs?

User2: Interesting. Speaking of dining options, have you tried the new caf√© that opened up near the library?

User1: No, I haven't. What kind of food do they serve?

User2: They have a lot of healthy options like salads and wraps, but they also have some indulgent treats like pastries and cakes.

User1: That sounds pretty good. I'll have to check it out sometime.

User2: Definitely. Have you heard about the upcoming career fair on campus?

User1: No, I haven't. When is it happening?

User2: It's next month. A lot of companies will be there, so it's a great opportunity to network and find job opportunities.

User1: That sounds really useful. I'll have to make sure to attend.

User2: Yeah, it's definitely worth it. Speaking of jobs, have you started looking for internships for next summer?

User1: Not yet, but I need to start soon. Do you have any tips for finding good internships?
