User1: Based on the schema, some values are prevalent.

User2: What do you mean by prevalent values?

User1: Oh, I mean the most frequent values or the values equal to the mode. For example, in the "list" table, the most prevalent grade is probably 9th grade.

User2: That makes sense. So, what kind of information can we get from these tables?

User1: Well, from the "list" table, we can see the names and grades of all the students in the school. And from the "teachers" table, we can see the names of all the teachers and the classrooms they teach in.

User2: That's interesting. Do you think we could use this information to find out which students are in which classrooms?

User1: Yes, we could. We would just have to look at the "list" table and see which students are in which grade and classroom. Then we could cross-reference that with the "teachers" table to see which teacher is in charge of each classroom.

User2: That sounds like a lot of work. Is there an easier way to do it?

User2: That's an interesting approach. Do you think we could use this database to find out which classrooms have the best performance?

User1: Yes, we could. We would just have to look at the "list" table and see which classrooms have the highest average grades.

User2: That's a good idea. Do you think we could use this database to find out which students are absent the most?

User1: Yes, we could. We would just have to look at the "list" table and see which students have the most absences.
