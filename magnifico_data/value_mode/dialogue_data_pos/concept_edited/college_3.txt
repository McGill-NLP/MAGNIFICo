User1: The Gradeconversion table shows the conversion from letter grades to grade points.

User2: Ah, I see. So how would we use that table?

User2: Can you explain how the Gradeconversion table is helpful?

User1: Sure. Let's say we have a student's grade in a course as a letter grade, like an A. We can use the Gradeconversion table to convert that letter grade to a grade point, which can then be used to calculate the student's GPA.

User2: That's interesting. So how does GPA affect a student's academic standing?

User1: GPA is an important factor in determining a student's academic standing. If a student's GPA falls below a certain threshold, they may be put on academic probation or even dismissed from the program.

User1: Me too! I think we could also use this database to track the progress of individual students over time.

User2: That's a great idea. We could see how their grades and course enrollment change from semester to semester.

User1: Exactly. And we could also use it to identify any patterns or trends in the data.

User2: Yes, like if certain majors tend to have higher GPAs or if there's a correlation between a student's age and their academic performance.
