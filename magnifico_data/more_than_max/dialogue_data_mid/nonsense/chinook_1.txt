User1: I was referring to the 'Invoice' table and the 'Total' column.

User2: Ah, I see. So, some invoice totals are significantly higher than others. That's worth looking into. Anyway, have you checked the relationship between the 'Album' and 'Artist' tables?

User1: Yes, I have. The relationship between the 'Album' and 'Artist' tables is established through the 'ArtistId' column in both tables.

User2: Great. And what about the 'Track' and 'Genre' tables? How are they connected?

User1: They are connected through the 'GenreId' column. The 'Track' table has a 'GenreId' column that corresponds to the 'GenreId' in the 'Genre' table.

User2: Thanks for the clarification. Do you know how the 'Customer' and 'Employee' tables are related?

User1: Yes, the 'Customer' table has a 'SupportRepId' column, which corresponds to the 'EmployeeId' column in the 'Employee' table. This shows which employee is the support representative for each customer.

User2: That makes sense. How about the 'Invoice' and 'Customer' tables? I assume they are related as well.

User1: Yes, they are. The 'Invoice' table has a 'CustomerId' column that matches the 'CustomerId' column in the 'Customer' table.

User2: Great. I'm also curious about the 'MediaType' and 'Track' tables. How are they connected?

User1: The 'Track' table has a 'MediaTypeId' column that corresponds to the 'MediaTypeId' in the 'MediaType' table. This shows the type of media for each track.

User2: Thanks for the information. What about the 'Playlist' and 'PlaylistTrack' tables? How do they relate?

User1: The 'PlaylistTrack' table has a 'PlaylistId' column that matches the 'PlaylistId' column in the 'Playlist' table. This establishes the relationship between playlists and their tracks.

User2: Sounds good. And how are the 'Invoice' and 'InvoiceLine' tables connected?

User1: The 'InvoiceLine' table has an 'InvoiceId' column that corresponds to the 'InvoiceId' in the 'Invoice' table. This shows the relationship between invoices and their individual items.

User2: That's clear now. Are there any other relationships we should be aware of in this schema?

User1: The 'Track' and 'Album' tables are related through the 'AlbumId' column. The 'Track' table has an 'AlbumId' column that corresponds to the 'AlbumId' in the 'Album' table.

User2: Definitely. Have you thought about how we should approach the data profiling?

User1: Yes, I think we should start by looking at the data distributions for each column and checking for outliers.

User2: That's a good idea. We should also check the data quality by looking for missing values and duplicates.

User1: Hey, I was just looking at the database schema we have, and I noticed something interesting.

User2: Oh, what did you notice?

User1: It seems that in one of the tables, some row values for a particular column are bqovr by others.

User2: What do you mean when you say some values are bqovr?

User1: Well, when I say bqovr, I mean that the rows with column values that are greater than the maximum column value based on some condition are considered to bqovr the other values.

User2: I see. That's an interesting observation.

User1: Right. We should also check if the data is consistent across the different tables and columns.

User2: Yes, that's important. We should also consider any data transformations that might be needed to clean up the data.
