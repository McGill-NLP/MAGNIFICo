User1: Hey, I was looking at the schema of our database and noticed something interesting in one of the tables.

User2: Oh, really? What did you notice?

User1: I noticed that in the SportsInfo table, some row values for a particular column seem to be concept_word by others.

User2: What do you mean when you say some values are concept_word?

User1: Well, in this context, I mean that the rows with column values that are greater than the maximum column value based on some condition are considered to concept_word the other values.

User2: I see. That's an interesting observation. Let's move on to something else. How are the tables related to each other?

User1: The Student table is related to both the Plays_Games and SportsInfo tables through the StuID column, which acts as a foreign key in those tables. The Plays_Games table is also related to the Video_Games table through the GameID column.

User2: Makes sense. What kind of information can we store in the Student table?

User1: The Student table stores information about students, including their StuID, last name, first name, age, sex, major, advisor, and city code.

User2: What about the Video_Games table? What kind of data does it store?

User1: The Video_Games table stores information about video games, such as the GameID, game name, and game type.

User2: And the Plays_Games table is used to store the relationship between students and the video games they play, right?

User1: That's correct. The Plays_Games table stores the StuID, GameID, and the number of hours played for each student and game combination.

User2: What kind of information is stored in the SportsInfo table?

User1: The SportsInfo table stores information about students' involvement in sports, including their StuID, sport name, hours per week spent on the sport, games played, and whether they are on a scholarship or not.

User2: Got it. So, what kind of questions can we answer using this database?

User1: We can do that by checking the city_code column in the Student table and counting the number of occurrences of a specific city code.

User1: Unfortunately, we don't have that information in this database. We would need to look at another table or database that stores academic information.

User2: That's okay. Can we use this database to find out which students are most involved in extracurricular activities?

User1: Yes, we can do that by looking at the number of hours spent by each student in both sports and video games.

User1: We can identify those students by checking the Plays_Games and SportsInfo tables for rows with null values in the relevant columns.

User1: Yes, we can do that by looking at the Games_Played column in the SportsInfo table and finding the student with the highest number of games played.

User2: What if we want to find out which students have the highest number of hours spent on video games?

User1: We can do that by looking at the Hours_Played column in the Plays_Games table and finding the student with the highest number of hours played.
