User1: Hey, I've been looking at the database schema we have for our university system, and I noticed that some row values for a particular column seem to be concept_word by others.

User2: Oh, really? What do you mean by concept_word in this context?

User1: I mean that the rows with column values that are greater than the maximum column value based on some condition are considered to concept_word the other values. It's just an observation I made while analyzing the schema.

User2: I see. Thanks for the clarification. So, which table and column are you referring to?

User1: I noticed it in the STUDENT table, specifically the STU_GPA column. It seems like some students have a significantly higher GPA than others.

User2: That's interesting. I wonder if there's a correlation between the high GPAs and the department they belong to. Have you noticed any trends in the DEPT_CODE column?

User1: I haven't checked that specifically, but it might be worth looking into. We could also check if there's a relationship between high GPAs and the total credit hours (STU_HRS) students have taken.

User2: That's a good idea. We should also consider whether students with a high STU_TRANSFER value are more likely to have higher GPAs.

User1: Yeah, that's another factor to consider. By the way, have you had a chance to look at the CLASS table? I'm curious about the distribution of class times and rooms.

User2: I did take a look at the CLASS table. It seems like there's a good mix of class times, but some rooms are used more frequently than others. It's probably due to the size and availability of the rooms.

User1: That makes sense. How about the PROFESSOR table? Are there any interesting patterns in the distribution of professors across departments?

User2: From what I've seen, some departments have more professors than others, which is expected. However, it's worth noting that some professors hold higher degrees (PROF_HIGH_DEGREE) than their colleagues in the same department.

User1: Interesting. I wonder if there's a correlation between the professors' degrees and the courses they teach. We could check the CLASS table to see if higher-degree professors are teaching more advanced courses.

User2: That's a great point. We could also look into the EMPLOYEE table to see if there's any relationship between a professor's hire date (EMP_HIREDATE) and their job code (EMP_JOBCODE). Maybe more experienced professors are assigned to teach certain courses.

User1: Yeah, that's another possibility. On a different note, have you checked the ENROLL table? I'm curious about the distribution of grades (ENROLL_GRADE) across different classes.

User2: I did briefly look at the ENROLL table. It seems like the distribution of grades varies across different classes. Some classes have a higher percentage of top grades, while others have a more balanced distribution.

User1: That's interesting. It might be useful to compare the grade distribution with the course credit (CRS_CREDIT) from the COURSE table to see if there's any relationship between the two.

User2: That's a good idea. We could also look at the DEPARTMENT table to see if there's any correlation between the department's overall performance and the courses offered by that department.
