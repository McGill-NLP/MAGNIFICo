User1: Hey, I was just looking at our database schema for Rooms and Reservations. I noticed that some row values for a particular column seem to be concept_word by others.

User2: Really? What do you mean by concept_word?

User1: Well, when I say concept_word, I mean that the rows with column values that are greater than the maximum column value based on some condition are considered to concept_word the other values.

User2: I see.

User1: I'm talking about the "basePrice" column in the Rooms table. Some room prices are significantly higher than others, which might affect our room bookings.
