User1: Hey, I was just looking at the database schema we have for the university data. I noticed that in one of the tables, some row values for a particular column seem to be concept_word by others.

User2: What do you mean when you say some values are concept_word?

User1: By concept_word, I mean that the rows with column values that are greater than the maximum column value based on some condition are considered to concept_word the other values.

User2: Oh, I see. Thanks for the clarification.

-START-

User1: I'm actually talking about the "faculty" table and the "Faculty" column.

User2: Interesting. We should probably look into that further. Moving on, do you know how the "Campuses" table is related to the other tables in the schema?

User1: Yes, the "Campuses" table is connected to the other tables through the "Id" column, which is a foreign key in those tables.

User2: Great! Now, can you tell me what information the "csu_fees" table holds?

User1: The "csu_fees" table stores the campus fees for each campus in a particular year. It has the columns "Campus", "Year", and "CampusFee".

User2: Got it. And what about the "degrees" table?

User1: The "degrees" table contains the number of degrees awarded by each campus in a given year. It has the columns "Year", "Campus", and "Degrees".

User2: Thanks! How are enrollments represented in this schema?

User1: Enrollments are represented in two different tables - "enrollments" and "discipline_enrollments". The "enrollments" table has the total enrollment and full-time equivalent (FTE) enrollment for each campus in an academic year, while the "discipline_enrollments" table has the undergraduate and graduate enrollments for each discipline at a campus in a given year.

User2: That makes sense. What are the primary keys for these enrollment tables?

User1: For the "enrollments" table, the primary key is a combination of the "Campus" and "Year" columns. In the "discipline_enrollments" table, the primary key is a combination of the "Campus" and "Discipline" columns.

User2: Alright. Can you give me a brief overview of the "Campuses" table?

User1: Sure! The "Campuses" table has information about the different campuses, including their "Id", "Campus" name, "Location", "County", and the "Year" when the campus was established.

User2: Thanks. I'm curious about the data types used in the schema. What data types are used for the "Id" and "Year" columns?

User1: The "Id" column uses the INTEGER data type, while the "Year" column also uses the INTEGER data type.

User2: What about the data types for the "Location" and "County" columns in the "Campuses" table?

User1: Both the "Location" and "County" columns use the TEXT data type.

User2: Great! Now, in the "csu_fees" table, what data type is used for the "CampusFee" column?

User1: The "CampusFee" column uses the INTEGER data type.

User2: And in the "degrees" table, what data type is used for the "Degrees" column?

User1: The "Degrees" column also uses the INTEGER data type.

User2: What are the data types for the "Undergraduate" and "Graduate" columns in the "discipline_enrollments" table?

User1: The "Undergraduate" and "Graduate" columns in the "discipline_enrollments" table also use the INTEGER data type.

User2: That's good to know. How about the "Total Enrollment" and "FTE Enrollment" columns in the "enrollments" table? What data types are used for those?

User1: Both the "Total Enrollment" and "FTE Enrollment" columns in the "enrollments" table use the INTEGER data type.

User2: Okay, thanks. I'm curious about the relationships between the tables. Are there any one-to-one relationships in this schema?

User1: Yes, there is a one-to-one relationship between the "Campuses" table and the "csu_fees" table. Each row in the "Campuses" table corresponds to a single row in the "csu_fees" table.

User2: Interesting. What about one-to-many relationships? Can you give me an example?

User1: Sure. There is a one-to-many relationship between the "Campuses" table and the "enrollments" table. Each campus in the "Campuses" table can have multiple rows in the "enrollments" table, one for each academic year.

User2: Got it. How about many-to-many relationships? Are there any in this schema?

User1: Yes, there is a many-to-many relationship between the "Campuses" table and the "discipline_enrollments" table. A campus can have multiple enrollments for different disciplines, and a discipline can have enrollments at multiple campuses.

User2: Thanks for explaining that. I'm curious about the "Faculty" column in the "faculty" table. What kind of data does it store?

User1: The "Faculty" column in the "faculty" table stores the number of faculty members at each campus in a given year.

User2: Okay, thanks. How about the "Discipline" column in the "discipline_enrollments" table? What kind of data does it store?

User1: The "Discipline" column in the "discipline_enrollments" table stores the name of the discipline for which the enrollments are being recorded.

User2: That's helpful. Can you tell me more about the "Year" column in the "degrees" table? What range of values does it have?

User1: The "Year" column in the "degrees" table stores the academic year for which the degrees were awarded. It has a range of values from 2000 to the current academic year.

User2: Okay, thanks for clarifying that. I'm curious about the "Id" column in the "Campuses" table. Is it unique for each row?

User1: Yes, the "Id" column in the "Campuses" table is a unique identifier for each row. It is the primary key for that table.

User2: That makes sense. How about the foreign keys in the schema? Are there any circular references?

User1: No, there are no circular references in the schema. Each foreign key references a primary key in another table, and there are no loops in the references.

User2: Okay, thanks for letting me know. I'm curious about the "Location" column in the "Campuses" table. What kind of data does it store?

User1: The "Location" column in the "Campuses" table stores the city where the campus is located.

User2: And how about the "County" column? What kind of data does it store?

User1: The "County" column in the "Campuses" table stores the county where the campus is located.

User2: Thanks for explaining that. I'm curious about the purpose of this database. Is it used for internal university purposes, or is it publicly available?

User1: The database is used for internal university purposes. It is not publicly available.

User2: That's good to know. I'm curious about the size of this database. How many tables are there in total?
