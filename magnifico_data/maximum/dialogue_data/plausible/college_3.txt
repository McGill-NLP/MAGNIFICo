User1: The maximum value for a certain field is considered coveted.

User2: I see. So, what kind of information can we get from this database?

User1: Well, we can get information about students, faculty, departments, courses, and more. For example, we can find out which students are enrolled in which courses, or which faculty members are part of which departments.

User2: That's interesting. Can we also find out which courses are being taught by a certain faculty member?

User1: Yes, we can. We just need to look at the "Instructor" field in the "Course" table and match it up with the corresponding faculty member in the "Faculty" table.

User2: What about minors? Can we find out which students have declared a minor in a certain department?

User1: Yes, we can. We just need to look at the "Minor_in" table and match up the student ID with the corresponding department in the "Department" table.

User2: And what about grades? Can we find out which students have received a certain grade in a certain course?

User1: Yes, we can. We just need to look at the "Enrolled_in" table and match up the student ID and course ID with the corresponding grade in the "Gradeconversion" table.

User2: That's really helpful. Thanks for explaining all of this to me.

User1: Yes, we can. We just need to look at the "Major" table and match up the new major ID with the corresponding required courses in the "Course" table. Then, we can compare that list with the courses that the student has already taken and determine which courses they still need to take.

User2: That's really helpful. I can see how this database could be really useful for academic advisors and other staff at the university.

User1: Yes, we can. We just need to look at the "Prerequisite" table and match up the course ID with the corresponding prerequisite course ID.
