User1: Hey, have you looked at the schema for the new database?

User2: Yeah, I have. Why do you ask?

User1: Well, I noticed that there are some values in there that will be coveted by a lot of people.

User2: What do you mean by coveted values?

User1: Oh, by coveted, I refer to the maximum values.

User2: I see what you mean. So, what do you think is the most important table in this database?

User1: Hmm, that's a tough one. I would say it's probably the Student table. It has all the basic information about each student, like their name, age, and major.

User2: Yeah, that makes sense. But what about the Allergy_Type and Has_Allergy tables? Don't you think those are important too?

User1: Definitely. The Allergy_Type table is important because it defines all the different types of allergies that a student can have. And the Has_Allergy table is important because it links each student to their allergies.

User2: Right. And I guess the city_code column in the Student table is important too, since it tells us where each student is from.

User1: Exactly. And the Advisor column is important because it tells us who each student's advisor is.

User2: Yeah, I can see how that would be useful. So, do you think this database will be easy to work with?

User1: It depends on how well the database is designed. But I think it should be relatively easy to work with.
