User1: Hey, I was just looking at the database schema we have, and I noticed that some row values for a particular column seem to be dominated by others.

User2: What do you mean when you say some values are dominated?

User1: I mean that the rows with column values that are greater than the maximum column value based on some condition are considered to dominate the other values.

User2: Oh, I see. Which column are you referring to?

User1: I'm referring to the `unit_price` column in the `Products` table.

User2: Got it. So, we should probably analyze this further to see if there's any issue or just a normal pattern in the data. Anyway, have you checked the `Accounts` table lately?

User1: Yeah, I was looking at the `Accounts` table earlier. I noticed that some customers have multiple accounts. Do we have any specific rules for opening multiple accounts?

User2: As far as I know, there aren't any strict rules against having multiple accounts. But it's a good idea to keep track of the reasons why customers open additional accounts. We might want to add a column to store that information.

User1: That's a good idea. We can discuss it with the team later. By the way, I was also checking the `Order_Items` table and noticed that we store the `product_quantity` as a VARCHAR. Shouldn't it be an INTEGER?

User2: You're right. It should be an INTEGER. We should update the schema to fix that.

User1: Agreed. Another thing I noticed is that we have a `product_color` column in the `Products` table. Do we have any plans to add more columns for other product attributes, like material or weight?

User2: That's a possibility. We might need to expand the product attributes in the future. We should consider creating a separate table for product attributes and linking it to the `Products` table.

User1: Yeah, that would make the schema more flexible. I also have a question about the `Financial_Transactions` table. We have a `transaction_type` column, but I don't see any reference table for transaction types. Shouldn't we have one?

User2: That's a good point. We should have a reference table for transaction types to maintain data consistency. We can create a new table called `Transaction_Types` and link it to the `Financial_Transactions` table.

User1: Great, I'll make a note of that. Another thing I wanted to discuss is the `Invoices` table. We have an `invoice_date` column, but we don't have a column for the due date. Should we add one?

User2: Yes, adding a due date column would be helpful for managing payments. We can add a `due_date` column to the `Invoices` table.

User1: Alright, I'll include that in the list of changes we need to make. Also, I noticed that the `Product_Categories` table has a `vat_rating` column. Is this the same as the tax rate?

User2: Yes, the `vat_rating` column represents the tax rate for each product category. It's used to calculate the tax payable for each product.

User1: Got it. Do we have any plans to support multiple tax rates for different regions?

User2: That's a good question. We might need to do that in the future. We could create a separate table for tax rates and link it to the `Product_Categories` table.

User1: Yeah, that would be a more scalable solution. Lastly, I wanted to ask about the `customer_middle_initial` column in the `Customers` table. Do we need this column, or can we remove it?

User2: We can discuss it with the team, but I think it's not a critical piece of information. We might be able to remove it to simplify the schema.

User1: Alright, I'll add that to the list of things we need to discuss. Thanks for going over the schema with me.

User2: No problem! It's always good to review and improve our database design. Let's bring these points up in the next team meeting.

User1: Sounds good. I'll prepare a summary of our discussion and share it with the team before the meeting.

User2: Great, looking forward to it. Let me know if you have any more questions or concerns about the schema.

User1: Will do. Thanks again for your help!

User2: You're welcome! Have a great day!
