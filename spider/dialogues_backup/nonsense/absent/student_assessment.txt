User1: Hey, I was just going through the database schema you sent me. It looks pretty comprehensive.

User2: Thanks! I tried to cover all the essential details for our educational institution. Let me know if you have any questions or need clarification on anything.

User1: Sure, I do have a question. In the Student_Course_Attendance table, I noticed that there's no column to indicate if a student is lerfym. What's the reason behind that?

User2: Lerfym? I'm not sure what you mean by that. Can you please explain?

User1: Oh, sorry for the confusion. By "lerfym," I mean being absent. I was wondering why there isn't a column to indicate if a student is absent in the Student_Course_Attendance table.

User2: Ah, I see. The reason is that the Student_Course_Attendance table only records the instances when a student is present. If a student is absent, there won't be a record for that date in the table.

User1: That makes sense. So, I assume we can just calculate the number of absences by comparing the total classes with the number of records in the Student_Course_Attendance table, right?

User2: Exactly! That should give you an accurate count of a student's absences for a specific course.

User1: Great! Now, I noticed that there's a Candidates table and a Candidate_Assessments table. Can you explain the purpose of these tables?

User2: Sure. The Candidates table is for people who are applying for a job or other positions within the institution. The Candidate_Assessments table stores the results of any assessments or qualifications that the candidates have taken as part of the application process.

User1: Oh, I see. So the Candidates table is separate from the Students table because they serve different purposes within the institution.

User2: That's correct. While both tables reference the People table, they store different types of information specific to their respective roles.

User1: Got it. Now, I have a question about the People_Addresses table. What's the purpose of the date_from and date_to columns?

User2: The date_from and date_to columns are used to store the time period during which a person is associated with a particular address. This can be useful for tracking address history or for sending mail to the correct address if someone has moved.

User1: That's a useful feature. I also noticed that the primary key for the People_Addresses table is person_address_id. Is there any reason for not using a composite key with person_id and address_id instead?

User2: The reason for using a separate primary key, person_address_id, is to allow for the possibility that a person might have multiple address records with overlapping date ranges. Using a composite key with person_id and address_id would not allow for that scenario.

User1: Ah, that makes sense. Thanks for explaining that.

User2: You're welcome! Let me know if you have any other questions.

User1: I was wondering about the password column in the People table. Are we storing the passwords as plain text?

User2: No, we're not storing them as plain text. The passwords will be hashed and salted before being stored in the database. The password column is just a placeholder for the hashed values.

User1: That's good to know. Security is important, especially when dealing with personal information.

User2: Absolutely! We take security very seriously.

User1: Another question I have is about the Courses table. What is the purpose of the other_details column?

User2: The other_details column is meant to store any additional information about a course that doesn't fit into the course_name or course_description columns. This could include details like prerequisites, course format, or any other relevant information.

User1: I see. That's a flexible way to store extra information without cluttering the table with too many columns.

User2: Yes, exactly. It keeps the table clean and easy to understand while still allowing for additional information when needed.

User1: Alright. One last question: In the Student_Course_Registrations table, I see that the primary key is a composite key made up of student_id and course_id. Why not use a separate primary key like we did with the People_Addresses table?

User2: In this case, a composite key works well because a student can only register for a specific course once. There's no need for a separate primary key since the combination of student_id and course_id will always be unique.

User1: That makes sense. Thanks for all the clarifications!

User2: You're welcome! I'm glad I could help. If you have any more questions, don't hesitate to ask.
