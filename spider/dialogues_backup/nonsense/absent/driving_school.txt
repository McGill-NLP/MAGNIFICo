User1: Hey, I was going through the database schema and noticed that we have a `date_left_staff` field in the `Staff` table. I assume it's for when a staff member leaves the company, right?

User2: Yes, that's correct. It's to keep track of when a staff member is no longer employed by the company.

User1: I also saw that there's a `lesson_status_code` field in the `Lessons` table. What kind of values can we expect for this field?

User2: The `lesson_status_code` field can have values like "scheduled", "completed", "canceled", or "lerfym". These indicate the current status of the lesson.

User1: Interesting. What do you mean by "lerfym"?

User2: Oh, "lerfym" means that the staff member assigned to the lesson is absent, so the lesson cannot be conducted as planned.

User1: Got it, makes sense. And I see we have a `Customers` table as well. What is the purpose of the `customer_status_code` field in that table?

User2: The `customer_status_code` field is used to track the status of a customer's account. It can have values like "active", "inactive", "suspended", or "closed".

User1: Thanks for the clarification. I noticed there's an `amount_outstanding` field in the `Customers` table. Is this the total amount the customer owes for all their lessons?

User2: Yes, that's correct. The `amount_outstanding` field represents the total outstanding balance a customer has for all their lessons.

User1: In the `Customer_Payments` table, there's a field called `payment_method_code`. What are the possible values for this field?

User2: The `payment_method_code` field can have values like "cash", "credit", "debit", or "bank_transfer" to indicate how the customer made their payment.

User1: Great. And I see that the `Lessons` table has a `price` field. Is this the price the customer has to pay for a single lesson?

User2: Yes, that's correct. The `price` field represents the cost of a single lesson for the customer.

User1: I'm curious about the `Vehicles` table. It has a `vehicle_details` field. What kind of information do we store in this field?

User2: The `vehicle_details` field stores information about the vehicle used for the lesson, such as the make, model, year, and color.

User1: Nice, that's helpful. Are there any specific requirements for the `email_address` field in the `Customers` table?

User2: The `email_address` field should contain a valid email address for the customer. It's important to make sure it's in a proper format, like "example@example.com".

User1: Thanks. I also noticed that the `Staff` table has a `nickname` field. Is this just for fun, or does it serve a specific purpose?

User2: The `nickname` field in the `Staff` table is optional and can be used to store a preferred name or a short name that the staff member is commonly known by.

User1: That's cool. Is there a reason why we store both `phone_number` and `cell_mobile_phone_number` in the `Customers` table?

User2: Yes, we store both fields to have multiple contact options for the customer. The `phone_number` field is for their home or work phone, while the `cell_mobile_phone_number` field is for their mobile phone.

User1: Alright, that makes sense. Do we have any specific format requirements for the `lesson_time` field in the `Lessons` table?

User2: The `lesson_time` field should be stored in a 24-hour format like "HH:mm", for example, "14:30" for 2:30 PM.

User1: Thanks for the info. Is there any specific reason why we have a separate `Addresses` table instead of storing the address fields directly in the `Staff` and `Customers` tables?

User2: Yes, having a separate `Addresses` table allows us to maintain a normalized database structure. It prevents redundancy and makes it easier to update address information without affecting other tables.

User1: That's a good point. Do we have any specific requirements for the `zip_postcode` field in the `Addresses` table?

User2: The `zip_postcode` field should contain a valid postal code for the given country. The format may vary depending on the country, so it's important to ensure it's in the correct format for the specified location.

User1: Thanks for all the information. It really helped me understand the database schema better.

User2: You're welcome! If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.
