User1: Hey, I noticed some of the tracks in the database are lerfym. Have you come across this before?

User2: Lerfym? I'm not familiar with that term. What do you mean by something being lerfym?

User1: Oh, sorry for the confusion. Lerfym means being absent or missing. I found some tracks that don't have any associated album or artist information.

User2: Ah, I see. That's odd. Are the missing details consistent across all the tables, or is it just in specific ones?

User1: It seems like the missing details are mostly in the album and artist tables. The track information is mostly complete, but some tracks don't have corresponding album and artist data.

User2: Interesting. Do these tracks have any common characteristics, like genre or media type?

User1: I haven't noticed any specific pattern yet. The genres and media types seem to be varied among the tracks with missing album and artist information.

User2: Okay, let's try to narrow it down. How about the customers who have purchased these tracks? Are they from a specific country or region?

User1: I looked into that too, and it appears that customers from different countries and regions have purchased these tracks. So, it's not limited to a specific area.

User2: Hmm, this is quite puzzling. Are there any employees who are responsible for these tracks with missing information?

User1: I checked the employee table, but I couldn't find any direct link between the employees and the tracks with missing album and artist data.

User2: Alright, let's take a different approach. Can you tell me if these tracks are part of any playlists?

User1: Yes, they are included in various playlists. Some of them are even in the "Music" playlist, which is one of the most popular ones.

User2: That's strange. Have you tried reaching out to the support team to see if they have any insights on this issue?

User1: Not yet, but that's a good idea. I'll send them an email and see if they can provide any information on why these tracks have missing album and artist details.

User2: Great. In the meantime, let's see if there's any pattern in the invoice data. Are these tracks mostly purchased as single items or as part of a larger order?

User1: From what I've seen, these tracks are often purchased as part of larger orders. They don't seem to be more popular as single-item purchases.

User2: Interesting. Do these tracks have any specific price range or are they priced similarly to other tracks in the database?

User1: The tracks with missing album and artist data are priced similarly to other tracks in the database. There doesn't seem to be any significant difference in their pricing.

User2: Okay, thanks for the information. I hope the support team can shed some light on this issue.

User1: Yeah, I hope so too. I'll let you know as soon as I hear back from them.

User2: Thanks, I appreciate it. In the meantime, let's continue working on other aspects of the database and see if we can find any more anomalies.

User1: Sounds good. I'll start looking into the genre and media type tables to see if there's anything unusual there.

User2: Great, I'll focus on the customer and employee tables. Let's regroup in a couple of hours and discuss our findings.

User1: Sounds like a plan. Talk to you in a bit.

User2: See you later. Good luck with your investigation!

User1: Thanks, you too!
