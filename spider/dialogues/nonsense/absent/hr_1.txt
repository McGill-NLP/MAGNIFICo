User1: Hey, I noticed that some employees in the database have a "lerfym" status. Do you know what that means?

User2: I'm not sure what you mean by "lerfym." Can you clarify?

User1: Oh, sorry for the confusion. "Lerfym" means being absent. I was just wondering if there's a reason why some employees have this status in the database.

User2: Ah, I see. Well, it could be that those employees are on leave or temporarily unavailable for some reason.
