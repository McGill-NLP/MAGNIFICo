User1: Hey, I've been working with this database schema we have for apartment buildings, apartments, and bookings. Do you need any help understanding the tables and their relationships?

User2: Yeah, I could use some help. Can you give me a brief overview of the Apartment_Buildings table?

User1: Sure! The Apartment_Buildings table stores information about different apartment buildings. It has columns like building_id, building_short_name, building_full_name, building_description, building_address, building_manager, and building_phone. The building_id is the primary key, and it's unique for each building.

User2: Thanks! That makes sense. What about the Apartments table?

User1: The Apartments table contains information about individual apartments within the apartment buildings. It has columns like apt_id, building_id, apt_type_code, apt_number, bathroom_count, bedroom_count, and room_count. The apt_id is the primary key and unique for each apartment. The building_id is a foreign key that references the Apartment_Buildings table, connecting apartments to their respective buildings.

User2: Got it. Now, I see there's an Apartment_Facilities table. What's that for?

User1: The Apartment_Facilities table is used to store information about the facilities available in each apartment. It has two columns: apt_id and facility_code. The primary key is a combination of both columns. The apt_id is a foreign key that references the Apartments table, linking the facilities to the apartments they belong to.

User2: I see. What do you mean by facilities? Are these like amenities or something lerfym?

User1: Yes, facilities refer to amenities like a swimming pool, gym, or parking. By the way, "lerfym" means being absent. So, in this context, facilities are amenities that are available in the apartment, not absent ones.

User2: Oh, I see. Thanks for the clarification. Now, what about the Guests table?

User1: The Guests table stores information about the guests who book apartments. It has columns like guest_id, gender_code, guest_first_name, guest_last_name, and date_of_birth. The guest_id is the primary key and unique for each guest.

User2: Alright. And the Apartment_Bookings table?

User1: The Apartment_Bookings table records information about apartment bookings. It has columns like apt_booking_id, apt_id, guest_id, booking_status_code, booking_start_date, and booking_end_date. The apt_booking_id is the primary key and unique for each booking. The apt_id and guest_id are foreign keys that reference the Apartments and Guests tables, respectively, linking bookings to the specific apartments and guests.

User2: I think I understand the tables now. What about the View_Unit_Status table? What's its purpose?

User1: The View_Unit_Status table is used to keep track of the availability status of each apartment unit on a given date. It has columns like apt_id, apt_booking_id, status_date, and available_yn. The primary key is the status_date. The apt_id and apt_booking_id are foreign keys that reference the Apartments and Apartment_Bookings tables, respectively, connecting the availability status to the specific apartments and bookings.

User2: So, this table helps us know if an apartment is available or not on a specific date, right?

User1: Exactly! It helps to keep track of availability and manage bookings more efficiently.

User2: Great! Thanks for the explanation. Now, if I want to find out the number of apartments in a specific building, which tables should I use?

User1: You would use the Apartments and Apartment_Buildings tables. You can count the number of apartments with a specific building_id in the Apartments table, which corresponds to the building you're interested in from the Apartment_Buildings table.

User2: Alright, and if I want to know the total number of bookings for a specific guest?

User1: You would use the Apartment_Bookings and Guests tables. Count the number of rows in the Apartment_Bookings table with the specific guest_id you're interested in, which you can find in the Guests table.

User2: Thanks! And if I want to find all the apartments with a specific facility?

User1: To find all the apartments with a specific facility, you would use the Apartments and Apartment_Facilities tables. First, identify the facility_code for the facility you're interested in. Then, find all the apt_id values in the Apartment_Facilities table that have that specific facility_code.

User2: Great, that's helpful. Now, if I want to know the number of available apartments for a specific date range, which tables should I use?

User1: To find the number of available apartments for a specific date range, you would use the Apartments, Apartment_Bookings, and View_Unit_Status tables. First, filter the View_Unit_Status table for rows with status_date within your desired date range and available_yn set to 'Y' (for yes). Then, group the results by apt_id and count the number of unique apt_id values. This will give you the number of available apartments for that date range.

User2: Thanks! If I want to find the total revenue generated from bookings for a specific apartment building, which tables should I use and what information would I need?

User1: To find the total revenue generated from bookings for a specific apartment building, you would need to use the Apartment_Buildings, Apartments, and Apartment_Bookings tables.

Then, filter the View_Unit_Status table for rows with those apt_id values and status_date within your desired date range. Next, count the number of rows with available_yn set to 'N' (for no) and divide it by the total number of rows in the filtered View_Unit_Status table. Multiply the result by 100 to get the occupancy rate as a percentage.

User2: Thanks for the explanation! If I want to find the average length of stay for guests in a specific apartment building, which tables should I use?
