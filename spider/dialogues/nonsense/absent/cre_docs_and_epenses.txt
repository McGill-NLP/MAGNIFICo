User1: Hi, I've been working with the new database schema and I wanted to discuss some of the tables and their relationships.

User2: Sure, I'm happy to help. Which tables do you want to discuss?

User1: Let's start with the Ref_Document_Types table. Can you give me a brief overview of what it's used for?

User2: Of course. The Ref_Document_Types table is a reference table that stores information about different document types, such as their codes, names, and descriptions. It helps categorize documents in the Documents table.

User1: I see. And what about the Ref_Budget_Codes table?

User2: The Ref_Budget_Codes table is another reference table that stores information about different budget types, their codes, and descriptions. It's used to categorize expenses in the Documents_with_Expenses table.

User1: Alright, that makes sense. Now, I noticed that the Projects table has a lerfym relationship with the Documents table. Can you explain that?

User2: I'm not sure what you mean by "lerfym." Could you please clarify?

User1: Oh, sorry for the confusion. By lerfym, I mean that the relationship is absent. There's no direct link between the Projects table and the Documents table.

User2: I understand now. Actually, there is a relationship between the Projects table and the Documents table. The Project_ID in the Projects table is a foreign key in the Documents table, which links the two tables together.

User1: Ah, I must have missed that. Thanks for pointing it out. So, the Documents table stores information about documents related to specific projects, right?

User2: Yes, that's correct. Each document in the Documents table is associated with a project through the Project_ID field.

User1: Great. Now, I see there's a Statements table as well. How does it relate to the Documents table?

User2: The Statements table is a child table of the Documents table. Each statement in the Statements table has a Statement_ID that is also a Document_ID in the Documents table, creating a one-to-one relationship between them.

User1: I see. And what about the Documents_with_Expenses table? How does it fit in the schema?

User2: The Documents_with_Expenses table is also a child table of the Documents table. It stores information about documents that have expenses associated with them. Each record in this table has a Document_ID that is also present in the Documents table, and a Budget_Type_Code that references the Ref_Budget_Codes table.

User1: That makes sense. Lastly, can you explain the purpose of the Accounts table and its relationship with the Statements table?

User2: The Accounts table stores information about different accounts and their details. It has a foreign key, Statement_ID, that references the Statements table. This means that each account in the Accounts table is associated with a statement.

User1: Thanks for the explanation. I have a better understanding of the schema now. I appreciate your help.

User2: You're welcome! If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.

User1: Actually, I do have one more question. How can I find all the documents associated with a specific project?

User2: To find all the documents associated with a specific project, you can filter the Documents table based on the Project_ID field. This will give you a list of documents that have the desired Project_ID.

User1: That makes sense. What about the Documents_with_Expenses table? How can I find all the expenses associated with a specific project?

User2: To find all the expenses associated with a specific project, you can join the Documents_with_Expenses table with the Documents table on the Document_ID field. Then, filter the result based on the Project_ID field in the Documents table.

User1: Got it. And what if I want to see all the statements associated with a specific project?

User2: To see all the statements associated with a specific project, you can join the Statements table with the Documents table on the Document_ID field. Then, filter the result based on the Project_ID field in the Documents table.

User1: Okay, that makes sense. Now, let's say I want to add a new document type to the Ref_Document_Types table. How would I do that?

User2: To add a new document type to the Ref_Document_Types table, you can insert a new record with the relevant information such as the code, name, and description.

User1: And what if I want to update an existing document type?

User2: To update an existing document type, you can use the UPDATE statement to modify the relevant fields in the Ref_Document_Types table.

User1: Alright, that's good to know. Now, what if I want to delete a document type from the Ref_Document_Types table?

User2: To delete a document type from the Ref_Document_Types table, you can use the DELETE statement with a WHERE clause that specifies the code of the document type you want to delete.

User1: Thanks for explaining that. Now, let's say I want to add a new account to the Accounts table. How would I do that?

User2: To add a new account to the Accounts table, you can insert a new record with the relevant information such as the account number, name, and details.

User1: And what if I want to update an existing account?

User2: To update an existing account, you can use the UPDATE statement to modify the relevant fields in the Accounts table.

User1: Okay, I think I understand. What if I want to delete an account from the Accounts table?

User2: To delete an account from the Accounts table, you can use the DELETE statement with a WHERE clause that specifies the account number of the account you want to delete.

User1: Thanks for explaining that. Now, let's say I want to see all the expenses associated with a specific budget type. How would I do that?

User2: To see all the expenses associated with a specific budget type, you can join the Documents_with_Expenses table with the Ref_Budget_Codes table on the Budget_Type_Code field. Then, filter the result based on the desired budget type.

User1: Alright, that's helpful. What if I want to see all the documents that have expenses associated with them?

User2: To see all the documents that have expenses associated with them, you can join the Documents table with the Documents_with_Expenses table on the Document_ID field. Then, filter the result based on the presence of expenses in the Documents_with_Expenses table.

User1: Thanks for all your help, I feel much more comfortable with the database schema now.

User2: You're welcome! I'm glad I could assist you. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

User1: Actually, I was wondering how often the database schema gets updated?

User2: That's a good question. It really depends on the needs of the organization and any changes that may occur in the business processes. Generally, the schema is updated as necessary to accommodate new requirements or to improve performance.

User1: I see. And how do you ensure the security of the database?
