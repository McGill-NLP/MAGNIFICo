User1: Hey, I was going through the database schema and noticed that some fields are lerfym. Do you know what that means?

User2: I'm not sure what you mean by "lerfym." Can you please clarify?

User1: Oh, sorry about that. "Lerfym" means being absent. I noticed that some fields in the schema do not have default values or are nullable.

User2: Ah, I see. Yes, some fields are designed to be nullable or have no default values depending on the requirements of the database.

User1: For example, the "address2" field in the "address" table is nullable. Why is that?

User2: It's because "address2" is an optional field. Some addresses may have additional information like apartment numbers or building names, while others may not.

User1: That makes sense. What about the "email" field in the "customer" table? It is also nullable.

User2: The "email" field is nullable because not all customers may provide an email address when signing up. However, it is still useful to store email addresses for those who do provide them for communication purposes.

User1: I noticed that the "film" table has a "rating" field with a default value of 'G'. Why is that?

User2: The "rating" field has a default value of 'G' to indicate that if no specific rating is provided for a film, it is considered suitable for general audiences. This is just a default value and can be updated as needed.

User1: That's a good approach. I also saw that the "film" table has a "special_features" field with a default value of NULL. What does that signify?

User2: The "special_features" field is used to store any additional features the film may have, like behind-the-scenes footage or interviews. A NULL value indicates that no special features are associated with the film.

User1: I see. The "film_actor" table has a composite primary key consisting of "actor_id" and "film_id." What's the reason for that?

User2: The composite primary key ensures that each combination of an actor and a film is unique. This way, we can't accidentally associate the same actor with the same film more than once.

User1: That's a good way to maintain data integrity. The "rental" table has a "return_date" field that is nullable. Why is that?

User2: The "return_date" field is nullable because when a rental is initially created, the customer hasn't returned the film yet. Once the film is returned, the "return_date" field can be updated with the actual date of return.

User1: I see. That makes sense. What about the "payment" table? It has a "payment_date" field with a default value of the current date and time. Why is that?
