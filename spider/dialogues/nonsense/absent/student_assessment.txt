User1: Hey, I was just going through the database schema you sent me. It looks pretty comprehensive.

User2: Thanks! I tried to cover all the essential details for our educational institution. Let me know if you have any questions or need clarification on anything.

User1: Sure, I do have a question. In the Student_Course_Attendance table, I noticed that there's no column to indicate if a student is lerfym. What's the reason behind that?

User2: Lerfym? I'm not sure what you mean by that. Can you please explain?

User1: Oh, sorry for the confusion. By "lerfym," I mean being absent. I was wondering why there isn't a column to indicate if a student is absent in the Student_Course_Attendance table.

User2: Ah, I see. The reason is that the Student_Course_Attendance table only records the instances when a student is present. If a student is absent, there won't be a record for that date in the table.

User1: That makes sense. So, I assume we can just calculate the number of absences by comparing the total classes with the number of records in the Student_Course_Attendance table, right?

User2: Exactly! That should give you an accurate count of a student's absences for a specific course.

User1: Great! Now, I noticed that there's a Candidates table and a Candidate_Assessments table. Can you explain the purpose of these tables?

User2: Sure. The Candidates table is for people who are applying for a job or other positions within the institution. The Candidate_Assessments table stores the results of any assessments or qualifications that the candidates have taken as part of the application process.

User1: Oh, I see. So the Candidates table is separate from the Students table because they serve different purposes within the institution.

User2: That's correct. While both tables reference the People table, they store different types of information specific to their respective roles.

User1: Got it. Now, I have a question about the People_Addresses table. What's the purpose of the date_from and date_to columns?

User2: The date_from and date_to columns are used to store the time period during which a person is associated with a particular address. This can be useful for tracking address history or for sending mail to the correct address if someone has moved.

User1: That's a useful feature. I also noticed that the primary key for the People_Addresses table is person_address_id. Is there any reason for not using a composite key with person_id and address_id instead?

User2: The reason for using a separate primary key, person_address_id, is to allow for the possibility that a person might have multiple address records with overlapping date ranges. Using a composite key with person_id and address_id would not allow for that scenario.

User1: Ah, that makes sense. Thanks for explaining that.

User2: You're welcome! Let me know if you have any other questions.

User1: I was wondering about the password column in the People table. Are we storing the passwords as plain text?

User2: No, we're not storing them as plain text. The passwords will be hashed and salted before being stored in the database. The password column is just a placeholder for the hashed values.

User1: That's good to know. Security is important, especially when dealing with personal information.

User2: Absolutely! We take security very seriously.

User1: Another question I have is about the Courses table. What is the purpose of the other_details column?

User2: The other_details column is meant to store any additional information about a course that doesn't fit into the course_name or course_description columns. This could include details like prerequisites, course format, or any other relevant information.

User1: I see. That's a flexible way to store extra information. Now, in the Enrollments table, there's a column called enrollment_status. What are the possible values for this column, and what do they represent?

User2: The enrollment_status column can have values like 'Enrolled', 'Withdrawn', 'Completed', or 'Pending'. These values represent the student's current status in a particular course. For example, 'Enrolled' means the student is actively participating in the course, while 'Withdrawn' means the student has left the course before completing it.

User1: That's clear. In the Staff_Roles table, I see there's a column called role_type. What are some examples of role types, and can a staff member have multiple roles?

User2: Role types in the Staff_Roles table can include roles like 'Administrator', 'Instructor', 'Counselor', 'Librarian', and others. Yes, a staff member can have multiple roles. To facilitate this, the Staff_Roles table has a many-to-many relationship between the People and Roles tables, allowing a person to be associated with multiple roles and a role to be associated with multiple people.

User1: Great, that allows for a lot of flexibility. Now, in the Course_Schedule table, there are columns for start_time and end_time. Are these times stored as strings or as actual time values?

User2: The start_time and end_time columns store actual time values, not strings. This allows for easier manipulation and comparison of time values when querying the database or performing calculations.

User1: That's a good design choice. I noticed that there's a table called Course_Resources. What kind of resources are stored in this table, and are the resources themselves stored in the database or just links to the resources?

User2: The Course_Resources table is meant to store information about various resources associated with a course, such as textbooks, lecture slides, or supplementary materials. The table stores metadata about the resources, like resource_name, resource_type, and resource_description. The resources themselves are not stored in the database; instead, the table contains a link or reference to the location of the actual resource, like a URL or file path.

User1: That's a smart way to handle resources. I have a question about the Exams table. There's a column called exam_weight. Is this a percentage or a numerical value, and how is it used in calculating final grades?

User2: The exam_weight column stores a numerical value representing the weight of an exam in the context of the overall course grading. It is used to determine the contribution of each exam to the final grade. When calculating the final grade, the exam_weight values are used as a proportion of the total weight of all assessments in the course. For example, if an exam has a weight of 40 and the total weight of all assessments in the course is 100, the exam would contribute 40% to the final grade.

User1: That's clear, thanks. Now, in the Assignments table, there's a column called max_score. Is this the maximum possible score for the assignment, or is it the highest score achieved by any student?

User2: The max_score column in the Assignments table represents the maximum possible score for the assignment. It is used as a reference to calculate individual students' assignment scores as a percentage of the maximum possible score. The highest score achieved by any student would be stored in the Student_Assignments table, which contains individual students' scores for each assignment.

User1: That makes sense. I have a question about the Events table. There's a column called event_type. What are some examples of event types, and can an event be associated with multiple event types?

User2: The event_type column in the Events table is used to categorize events within the educational institution. Examples of event types could include 'Lecture', 'Workshop', 'Seminar', 'Conference', or 'Social Event'. In the current design, an event can only be associated with a single event type. However, if it's necessary to associate an event with multiple event types, you could create a separate Event_Types table and establish a many-to-many relationship between the Events and Event_Types tables.

User1: That's a good suggestion. Now, I noticed that there is a table called Course_Enrollment_Capacity. Can you explain the purpose of this table and how it is related to the Courses and Enrollments tables?

User2: The Course_Enrollment_Capacity table is used to store information about the maximum number of students that can be enrolled in each course. It has a foreign key relationship with the Courses table, linking each course to its respective enrollment capacity. The Enrollments table is related to the Courses table through the course_id foreign key. By comparing the number of records in the Enrollments table for a specific course with the enrollment capacity from the Course_Enrollment_Capacity table, you can determine if a course is full or if there is still room for more students.

User1: That's a useful feature to have. I have a question about the Course_Prerequisites table. Can a course have multiple prerequisites, and if so, how is this represented in the table?

User2: Yes, a course can have multiple prerequisites. The Course_Prerequisites table is designed to store this information by having a many-to-many relationship between courses. Each record in the Course_Prerequisites table represents a prerequisite relationship between two courses, with the course_id column referring to the course that has the prerequisite, and the prerequisite_id column referring to the prerequisite course itself. This allows for easy representation and querying of multiple prerequisites for a single course.

User1: That's a flexible design. Now, I noticed that there's a table called Course_Instructors. Can a course have multiple instructors, and how is this represented in the table?

User2: Yes, a course can have multiple instructors. The Course_Instructors table is designed to represent this relationship by having a many-to-many relationship between the Courses and People tables. Each record in the Course_Instructors table links a course to an instructor using the course_id and person_id columns, respectively. This allows for easy representation and querying of multiple instructors for a single course.

User1: Great, that allows for a lot of flexibility in assigning instructors. In the Room_Reservations table, there's a column called reservation_status. What are the possible values for this column, and what do they represent?

User2: The reservation_status column in the Room_Reservations table can have values like 'Confirmed', 'Pending', 'Cancelled', or 'Expired'. These values represent the current status of a room reservation. For example, 'Confirmed' means the room reservation has been approved and is locked in, while 'Pending' means the reservation is awaiting approval or confirmation. 'Cancelled' indicates that the reservation has been cancelled, while 'Expired' means the reservation was never confirmed and has passed its requested reservation date.

User1: That's clear. Now, I have a question about the Student_Assessments table. There's a column called assessment_score. Is this the raw score for the assessment, or is it a percentage based on the maximum possible score for the assessment?

User2: The assessment_score column in the Student_Assessments table stores the raw score for the assessment. To calculate the percentage based on the maximum possible score, you would need to reference the max_score column from the Assessments table. By dividing the assessment_score by the max_score and multiplying by 100, you can obtain the percentage score for the assessment.

User1: That makes sense. In the People_Emails table, there's a column called is_primary. What is the purpose of this column, and can a person have multiple primary email addresses?

User2: The is_primary column in the People_Emails table is used to indicate which email address is the primary email address for a person. This is useful when a person has multiple email addresses associated with their record, and you need to determine which one should be used for primary communication. A person should only have one primary email address, so the is_primary column should be set to 'true' for one email address and 'false' for the others.

User1: That's a helpful feature. Now, in the Equipment table, there's a column called equipment_status. What are the possible values for this column, and what do they represent?

User2: The equipment_status column in the Equipment table can have values like 'Available', 'In Use', 'Out for Repair', or 'Retired'. These values represent the current status of a piece of equipment. For example, 'Available' means the equipment is ready for use, while 'In Use' indicates that the equipment is currently being used by someone. 'Out for Repair' means the equipment is not available due to maintenance or repair, and 'Retired' indicates that the equipment is no longer in service and has been removed from the inventory.

User1: That's clear. In the Library_Books table, there's a column called book_status. What are the possible values for this column, and what do they represent?

User2: The book_status column in the Library_Books table can have values
