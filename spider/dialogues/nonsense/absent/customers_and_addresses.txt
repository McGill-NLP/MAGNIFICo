User1: Hey, I was just going through the database schema and noticed that we have a table for Addresses and another one for Customer_Addresses. Do you know why we have two separate tables for this?

User2: Yeah, the `Addresses` table holds the actual address information, while the `Customer_Addresses` table is used to establish a relationship between customers and their addresses. It's a way to normalize the data and avoid redundancy.

User1: Oh, I see. That makes sense. By the way, have you noticed that some of the customers' addresses are lerfym in the database?

User2: Lerfym? I'm not familiar with that term. What do you mean by that?

User1: Sorry, I should have been clearer. Lerfym means being absent. So, I noticed that some customers don't have any associated addresses in the database.

User2: Oh, I understand now. That's strange. We should probably look into that and find out why some customers don't have addresses.

User1: Yeah, I agree. Also, I noticed that the `Customer_Contact_Channels` table has an `active_from_date` and an `active_to_date`. What's the purpose of these columns?

User2: Those columns are used to track the time period during which a particular contact channel was active for a customer. For example, if a customer changed their phone number, we would update the `active_to_date` for the old number and add a new entry with the new number and a new `active_from_date`.

User1: That's a good approach. It helps maintain a history of contact channels for each customer. On a different note, I see that the `Customer_Orders` table has an `order_status` column. What kind of values can we expect in this column?

User2: The `order_status` column typically contains values like "Pending", "Processing", "Shipped", "Delivered", or "Cancelled" to indicate the current status of a customer's order.

User1: Great. That helps in tracking the progress of orders. I also noticed that the `Order_Items` table has a column called `order_quantity`. Shouldn't this be an INTEGER type instead of VARCHAR(15)?

User2: You're right! That seems to be a mistake. The `order_quantity` column should indeed be an INTEGER type to store the quantity of products in an order. We should correct that.

User1: I'll make a note of that. By the way, do we have any constraints on the `payment_method` column in the `Customers` table? It's currently set as VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL.

User2: We don't have any specific constraints on the `payment_method` column, but it typically contains values like "Credit Card", "Debit Card", "PayPal", or "Bank Transfer". We should probably add a CHECK constraint to ensure that only valid payment methods are entered.

User1: That's a good idea. It will help maintain data integrity. Another thing I noticed is that the `customer_name` column in the `Customers` table is VARCHAR(80), but there's no NOT NULL constraint. Shouldn't we have that to ensure we always have a customer's name?

User2: Yes, you're right. It's essential to have a customer's name, so adding a NOT NULL constraint to the `customer_name` column would be a good idea. Thanks for pointing that out.

User1: No problem. I also see that we have a `date_became_customer` column in the `Customers` table. Do we have any specific rules for setting this value?

User2: The `date_became_customer` column should be set to the date when the customer first made a purchase or created an account with us. It helps us keep track of how long they've been our customer.

User1: That's interesting. I also noticed that the `Products` table has a `product_description` column. Is there a character limit on this column?

User2: Yes, the `product_description` column is set to VARCHAR(500). We figured that 500 characters should be enough to describe a product adequately.

User1: That makes sense. I also see that the `Order_Items` table has a `unit_price` column. Is this the price at which the product was purchased or the current price of the product?

User2: The `unit_price` column contains the price at which the product was purchased. It's essential to maintain this information for accounting purposes.

User1: Got it. I also noticed that the `Orders` table has a `shipping_address_id` column. Does this mean that a customer can have multiple shipping addresses?

User2: Yes, that's correct. Customers can have multiple shipping addresses, and we store the ID of the selected address in the `shipping_address_id` column.

User1: That's good to know. I also see that the `Customers` table has a `customer_type` column. What are the possible values for this column?

User1: Okay, that's helpful. I also noticed that the `Orders` table has a `total_price` column. Is this the sum of all the `unit_price` values in the `Order_Items` table?

User2: Yes, that's correct. The `total_price` column contains the sum of all the `unit_price` values in the `Order_Items` table for a particular order.

User1: That's good to know. I also see that the `Customers` table has a `customer_since` column. Is this the same as the `date_became_customer` column?

User2: Yes, that's correct. The `customer_since` column is set to the same value as the `date_became_customer` column when a customer is added to the database.

User1: That's interesting. I also noticed that the `Order_Items` table has a `product_id` column. Is this the same as the `id` column in the `Products` table?

User2: Yes, that's correct. The `product_id` column in the `Order_Items` table is a foreign key that references the `id` column in the `Products` table.

User1: That makes sense. I also see that the `Orders` table has a `order_date` column. Is this the date when the order was placed or the date when it was shipped?

User1: That's helpful. I also noticed that the `Order_Items` table has a `tax_amount` column. Is this the tax applied to the entire order or just a specific product?

User2: The `tax_amount` column contains the tax applied to a specific product in the order. If there's tax applied to the entire order, it would be stored in the `Orders` table.

User1: I see. That's good to know. I also noticed that the `Orders` table has a `tracking_number` column. Is this the tracking number for the entire order or just a specific product?

User2: The `tracking_number` column contains the tracking number for the entire order. It's typically generated by the shipping carrier and used to track the package during transit.

User1: I also see that the `Customers` table has a `customer_phone` column. Is this the primary phone number for the customer?

User2: Yes, that's correct. The `customer_phone` column contains the primary phone number for the customer. We use this phone number to contact the customer if there are any issues with their order.

User1: Okay, that's good to know. I also noticed that the `Orders` table has a `shipping_method` column. What kind of values can we expect in this column?

User2: The `shipping_method` column typically contains values like "Standard", "Express", or "Overnight" to indicate the shipping speed selected by the customer.

User1: That's helpful. I also see that the `Order_Items` table has a `return_date` column. Is this the date when the customer returned the product?

User2: Yes, that's correct. The `return_date` column contains the date when the customer returned the product. We use this information to process refunds and track the number of returns.

User1: Okay, that's good to know. I also noticed that the `Customers` table has a `customer_address_verified` column. What does this column indicate?

User2: The `customer_address_verified` column indicates whether the customer's address has been verified. This is important for ensuring that orders are delivered to the correct address and reducing the risk of fraud.

User1: That's interesting. I also see that the `Orders` table has a `delivery_date` column. Is this the date when the package was delivered to the customer?

User2: Yes, that's correct. The `delivery_date` column contains the date when the package was delivered to the customer. It's important to track this information to ensure that packages are delivered on time.

User1: Okay, that's good to know. I also noticed that the `Order_Items` table has a `product_returned` column. What does this column indicate?

User2: The `product_returned` column indicates whether a specific product in the order was returned by the customer. If the value is set to `1`, it means that the product was returned. If the value is set to `0`, it means that the product was not returned.

User1: I see. That's helpful. I also noticed that the `Customers` table has a `customer_notes` column. What kind of information is stored in this column?

User2: The `customer_notes` column contains any additional notes or comments about the customer. This information can be useful for customer service representatives when dealing with specific customers.

User1: Okay, that's good to know. I also see that the `Orders` table has a `shipping_cost` column. Is this the cost of shipping for the entire order or just a specific product?

User1: I see. That's helpful. I also noticed that the `Order_Items` table has a `product_name` column. Is this the same as the `product_name` column in the `Products` table?

User2: Yes, that's correct. The `product_name` column in the `Order_Items` table is a denormalized column that contains the name of the product. It's redundant data, but it can be useful for reporting and analysis.

User1: Okay, that's good to know. I also see that the `Customers` table has a `customer_gender` column. Is this information necessary for our database?

User2: The `customer_gender` column is not strictly necessary, but it can be useful for demographic analysis and marketing purposes.

User1: I see. That's helpful. I also noticed that the `Orders` table has a `promo_code` column. Is this the code for a specific promotion applied to the entire order or just a specific product?
