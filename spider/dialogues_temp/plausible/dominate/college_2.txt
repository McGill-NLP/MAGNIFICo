User1: Hey, I was looking at the database schema you provided. It seems like some row values for a particular column are dominated by others.

User2: Oh, really? What do you mean by "dominated"?

User1: When I say "dominated," I mean that the rows with column values that are greater than the maximum column value based on some condition are considered to dominate the other values.

User2: I see. Thanks for pointing that out. Let's move on to discussing the tables in the schema. Can you tell me more about the "classroom" table?

User1: Sure. The "classroom" table has three columns: building, room_number, and capacity. The primary key is a combination of building and room_number.

User2: Great. How about the "department" table?

User1: The "department" table has three columns as well: dept_name, building, and budget. The primary key is dept_name, and there's a check constraint on the budget column to ensure it's greater than 0.

User2: What can you tell me about the "course" table?

User1: The "course" table has four columns: course_id, title, dept_name, and credits. The primary key is course_id. There's a foreign key constraint on dept_name, referencing the department table. If a department is deleted, the dept_name in the course table will be set to NULL.

User2: That makes sense. Now, let's discuss the "instructor" table.

User1: The "instructor" table has five columns: ID, name, dept_name, and salary. The primary key is ID. There's a foreign key constraint on dept_name, referencing the department table, and a check constraint on salary to ensure it's greater than 29,000.

User2: What about the "section" table?

User1: The "section" table has seven columns: course_id, sec_id, semester, year, building, room_number, and time_slot_id. The primary key is a combination of course_id, sec_id, semester, and year. There are foreign key constraints on course_id and the combination of building and room_number.

User2: Interesting. Can you explain the "teaches" table?

User1: The "teaches" table has six columns: ID, course_id, sec_id, semester, and year. The primary key is a combination of ID, course_id, sec_id, semester, and year. There are foreign key constraints on the combination of course_id, sec_id, semester, and year, as well as on ID.

User2: How about the "student" table?

User1: The "student" table has four columns: ID, name, dept_name, and tot_cred. The primary key is ID. There's a foreign key constraint on dept_name, referencing the department table, and a check constraint on tot_cred to ensure it's greater than or equal to 0.

User2: Thanks. Now, let's discuss the "takes" table.

User1: The "takes" table has six columns: ID, course_id, sec_id, semester, year, and grade. The primary key is a combination of ID, course_id, sec_id, semester, and year. There are foreign key constraints on the combination of course_id, sec_id, semester, and year, as well as on ID.

User2: What can you tell me about the "advisor" table?

User1: The "advisor" table has two columns: s_ID and i_ID. The primary key is s_ID. There are foreign key constraints on both s_ID and i_ID, referencing the student and instructor tables, respectively.

User2: Lastly, could you explain the "time_slot" and "prereq" tables?

User1: The "time_slot" table has six columns: time_slot_id, day, start_hr, start_min, end_hr, and end_min. The primary key is a combination of time_slot_id, day, start_hr, and start_min. There are check constraints on start_hr, start_min, end_hr, and end_min.

The "prereq" table has two columns: course_id and prereq_id. The primary key is a combination of course_id and prereq_id. There are foreign key constraints on both course_id and prereq_id, referencing the course table.

User2: Thank you for explaining the schema in detail. It's much clearer now.

User1: You're welcome! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.
