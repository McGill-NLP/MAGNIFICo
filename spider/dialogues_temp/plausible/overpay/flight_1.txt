User1: Hey, I see we have a new database schema for flights, aircraft, employees, and certificates. 

User2: Yeah, I noticed that too. It's going to help us keep track of flight details, aircraft information, and employee certifications.

User1: Definitely. By the way, have you had a chance to look at the employee salaries in the database? I think a lot of them are overpaid.

User2: I did glance through it. Some of them seem quite high. What's your interpretation of overpaid here?

User1: Well, in my opinion, anyone earning a salary more than 30,000 is overpaid. Anyway, let's get back to the database. I see that the flight table has a foreign key referencing the aircraft table.

User2: Yes, the aid column in the flight table refers to the aircraft's unique identifier, and it helps us know which aircraft is assigned to each flight.

User1: That's a smart way to organize the data. What about the certificate table? How does it relate to the other tables?

User2: The certificate table has two foreign keys, one referencing the employee table and the other referencing the aircraft table. It basically shows which employees are certified to operate which aircraft.

User1: Oh, I see. That's helpful for assigning pilots and crew members to specific flights.

User2: Exactly. And the employee table has a primary key, eid, which is the unique identifier for each employee.

User1: I noticed that the aircraft table also has a distance column. What does that represent?

User2: The distance column in the aircraft table represents the maximum distance an aircraft can travel. It's useful for determining if a specific aircraft is suitable for a given flight based on the flight's distance.

User1: That makes sense. And in the flight table, we have origin and destination columns. I assume they store the departure and arrival locations?

User2: Yes, that's correct. The origin column stores the departure location, and the destination column stores the arrival location for each flight.

User1: Great. The departure_date and arrival_date columns in the flight table must be used to store the scheduled departure and arrival times for each flight, right?

User2: Yes, you got it. They help us keep track of the flight schedules and manage bookings accordingly.

User1: I also see a price column in the flight table. I assume that's the cost of a ticket for that particular flight?

User2: Yes, exactly. The price column stores the ticket price for each flight, which can be useful for customers when they're booking flights and for us when we're analyzing revenue.

User1: This database schema seems well-organized and efficient. I think it will be very useful for managing our flight operations.

User2: I agree. It covers all the essential aspects of our operations, and it will help us make better decisions based on accurate and up-to-date information.

User1: Absolutely. I'm also impressed with the way the data is normalized. It will help us avoid redundancy and maintain data integrity.

User2: Yes, normalization is crucial for ensuring that the data is consistent and accurate. It also helps us avoid data anomalies and inconsistencies.

User1: Speaking of anomalies, have you noticed any anomalies in the data so far?

User2: Not yet, but we should keep an eye out for any inconsistencies or errors. We can also run some data validation checks to ensure that the data is correct and complete.

User1: That's a good idea. We should also consider implementing some data security measures to protect the data from unauthorized access or manipulation.

User2: Yes, data security is critical, especially since we're dealing with sensitive information such as employee salaries and certifications. We should implement proper access controls and encryption to safeguard the data.

User1: Agreed. We should also have a backup and recovery plan in place in case of any data loss or corruption.

User2: Definitely. We can set up regular backups and test the recovery process to ensure that we can quickly restore the data in case of any issues.

User1: Have you thought about how we can use this database to improve our operations and customer service?
