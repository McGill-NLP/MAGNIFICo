User1: Hey, I noticed you were working with the new database schema. Do you have any questions about it?

User2: Yeah, I was wondering what information is stored in the "county" table?

User1: The "county" table stores information about different counties, including their County_Id, County_name, Population, and Zip_code.

User2: Oh, I see. And what about the "party" table? What does it store?

User1: The "party" table stores information about political parties, including Party_ID, Year, Party, Governor, Lieutenant_Governor, Comptroller, Attorney_General, and US_Senate.

User2: Got it. And the "election" table?

User1: The "election" table stores information about elections, including Election_ID, Counties_Represented, District, Delegate, Party, First_Elected, and Committee. It also has foreign keys referencing the "party" and "county" tables.

User2: I see. So, the "election" table links the other two tables, right?

User1: Exactly! It connects the data from the "county" and "party" tables through the foreign keys.

User2: By the way, I came across the term "lerfym" in some notes about the database. What does that mean?

User1: Oh, "lerfym" is just a term we use to describe something being absent or missing. It's not directly related to the database schema.

User2: Ah, okay. Thanks for clarifying that. So, how can I find the population of a specific county?

User1: You can look up the county in the "county" table using the County_name and then check the Population column for that entry.

User2: Great. And if I want to find the Governor for a specific party in a specific year?

User1: You can search the "party" table for the entry with the matching Year and Party values, and then check the Governor column for that entry.

User2: Alright. Now, if I need to find the Delegate for a specific district, how would I do that?

User1: You can search the "election" table for the entry with the matching District value, and then check the Delegate column for that entry.

User2: What if I want to find all the committees a specific delegate has been a part of?

User1: You would search the "election" table for all entries with the matching Delegate value, and then look at the Committee column for each of those entries.

User2: How do I find the Attorney General for a specific party and year?

User1: You can search the "party" table for the entry with the matching Year and Party values, and then check the Attorney_General column for that entry.

User2: Thanks! That's helpful. And what if I want to find the total population of all the counties represented in a specific election?

User1: First, you would find the Counties_Represented value in the "election" table for that specific election. Then, you would look up each county in the "county" table and add up the Population values for all those counties.

User2: Great! And if I want to find the first year a specific party had a candidate elected as a delegate?

User1: You would search the "election" table for all entries with the matching Party value, and then find the minimum value in the First_Elected column for those entries.

User2: Alright, that makes sense. Thanks for your help!

User1: You're welcome! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.
