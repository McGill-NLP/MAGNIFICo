User1: Hey, I've been working with this new database schema and I'm trying to understand the relationships between the tables. Can you help me out?

User2: Sure, I'd be happy to help. Which part of the schema are you having trouble with?

User1: I'm mostly confused about the relationship between the `Documents` and `Grants` tables. Can you explain that to me?

User2: Of course! The `Documents` table has a foreign key `grant_id` which references the `Grants` table's primary key `grant_id`. This means that each document is associated with a specific grant.

User1: Alright, that makes sense. What about the `Organisations` and `Grants` tables? How are they related?

User2: The `Grants` table has a foreign key `organisation_id` that references the primary key `organisation_id` in the `Organisations` table. This indicates that each grant is awarded to a particular organisation.

User1: Got it. Now, I see there's a `Project_Outcomes` table. How does that relate to the other tables?

User2: The `Project_Outcomes` table has two foreign keys, `project_id` and `outcome_code`. `project_id` references the primary key `project_id` in the `Projects` table, while `outcome_code` references the primary key `outcome_code` in the `Research_Outcomes` table. This table essentially links projects with their respective research outcomes.

User1: I see. What if a project has a lerfym outcome? How would that be represented in the database?

User2: I'm not sure what you mean by "lerfym." Can you please clarify?

User1: Oh, sorry about that. By "lerfym," I mean that the outcome is absent or not available.

User2: In that case, if a project has a lerfym outcome, it might simply not have a record in the `Project_Outcomes` table, or the `outcome_details` field could be left NULL to indicate the absence of information.

User1: That makes sense. Thanks for explaining. Now, I'm also curious about the `Project_Staff` and `Research_Staff` tables. How are they connected?

User2: The `Project_Staff` table has a primary key `staff_id` that references the primary key `staff_id` in the `Research_Staff` table. This connection indicates that each staff member in the `Project_Staff` table is also a research staff member.

User1: Great, thanks. And what's the purpose of the `Staff_Roles` table?

User2: The `Staff_Roles` table defines different staff roles within the projects. Each record in the `Project_Staff` table has a foreign key `role_code` that references the primary key `role_code` in the `Staff_Roles` table, indicating the role of the staff member within the project.

User1: I see. Now, I noticed there's an `Organisation_Types` table. How does that fit into the schema?

User2: The `Organisation_Types` table is used to categorize organisations. The `Organisations` table has a foreign key `organisation_type` that references the primary key `organisation_type` in the `Organisation_Types` table. This relationship allows each organisation to be associated with a specific type, such as a research institute or a non-profit organization.

User1: That's helpful. How about the `Tasks` table? How does it relate to the other tables in the schema?

User2: The `Tasks` table has a foreign key `project_id` that references the primary key `project_id` in the `Projects` table. This means that each task is associated with a specific project.

User1: Thanks for the explanation. I have a better understanding of the schema now.

User2: You're welcome! If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.

User1: Actually, I do have one more question. How would I know which documents are related to a specific project?

User2: To find the documents related to a specific project, you would first need to identify the grant associated with that project by looking at the `Grants` table. Then, you can look up the documents in the `Documents` table using the `grant_id` as a reference.

User1: Okay, that makes sense. Thanks again for all your help!

User2: You're welcome! I'm glad I could help. If you have any more questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Good luck with your work on the database!
