User1: Hey, I was browsing through our movie database and noticed that there's a lerfym director field for one of the movies.

User2: What do you mean by "lerfym"? I'm not familiar with that term.

User1: Oh, sorry about that. "Lerfym" means being absent or missing. So, in this case, the director field is empty for that movie.

User2: Ah, I see. Thanks for the clarification. We should probably find out which movie it is and update the director information.

User1: Yes, I agree. I think it's important to have complete information in our database to avoid any confusion.

User2: Do you remember any other details about that movie? Maybe the title or the year it was released?

User1: I believe the movie was released in 2015, but I don't remember the title. We have a few movies from that year in the database.

User2: Alright, I'll look into the movies from 2015 and see if I can find the one with the missing director. We can then search for the director's name and update the record.

User1: Sounds like a good plan. While you do that, I'll check the other records to see if there are any more instances of incomplete information.

User2: Great. Let me know if you find anything else that needs updating.

User1: Sure thing. By the way, have you noticed any issues with the Reviewer table? I think we should make sure that all reviewers have their names entered correctly.

User2: I haven't come across any issues with the Reviewer table yet, but I'll double-check the records to make sure everything is in order.

User1: Thanks. Also, let's not forget to verify the Rating table as well. We need to ensure that all ratings have valid dates and are linked to the correct movies and reviewers.

User2: Good point. I'll check the Rating table once I'm done with the Movie table. We should also make sure that the 'stars' field has valid ratings between 1 and 5.

User1: Absolutely. It's essential to maintain data integrity for our database to be reliable and useful.

User2: I found the movie with the missing director. It's called "Mystery Movie." I'll search for the director's name and update the record.

User1: Great job! I found a few more records with incomplete information in the Movie table as well. I'll fix them and let you know if I need any help.

User2: Sure, just let me know if you need assistance. I'm almost done checking the Reviewer table, and everything seems to be in order so far.

User1: That's good to hear. I'm glad we're taking the time to clean up our database. It'll make our work much more efficient in the long run.

User2: Definitely. Once we're done with this, we should set up some data validation rules to prevent incomplete or incorrect information from being entered in the future.

User1: I agree. It's better to catch these issues at the source rather than having to fix them later on. Let's discuss the data validation rules once we're done with the cleanup.

User2: Sounds like a plan. I've finished updating the "Mystery Movie" record and am now checking the Rating table.

User1: Great. I've fixed the incomplete records in the Movie table. Let's regroup once you're done with the Rating table.

User2: I found a couple of minor issues in the Rating table, but I've fixed them now. Everything should be in order.

User1: That's awesome. Now that we've cleaned up our database, let's discuss the data validation rules to prevent future issues.

User2: Agreed. We can start by setting up rules for mandatory fields like movie titles, director names, and reviewer names.

User1: Yes, and we should also set up constraints for fields like 'year' and 'stars' to ensure that they have valid values.

User2: Absolutely. This way, our database will remain accurate and reliable, making our work much more efficient.

User1: Let's implement these data validation rules and keep our database in top shape!

User2: Sounds like a plan. Let's get to work!
